# Triliza Game Rules

## Overview

Triliza is a modern take on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, featuring multi-dimensional gameplay and enhanced scoring mechanics. The game supports both local two-player mode and online multiplayer.

## Basic Rules

### Objective
Score the most points by creating three-in-a-row patterns on the game board.

### Players
- **Player X** (starts first)
- **Player O** (goes second)

### Game Board
- Default board size: 3x3 grid
- Each cell is numbered from 1-9 (top-left to bottom-right)
- Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) in empty cells

## Scoring System

### Three-in-a-Row Patterns
Players earn points by creating three-in-a-row patterns in any direction:

1. **Horizontal** - Three symbols in the same row
2. **Vertical** - Three symbols in the same column  
3. **Diagonal** - Three symbols diagonally (both directions)

### Scoring Mechanics
- Each three-in-a-row pattern = **1 point**
- Multiple patterns can be created simultaneously
- Patterns are counted dynamically as the game progresses
- The player with the highest score when the board is full wins

## Game Flow

1. **Setup**: Board starts empty with numbered cells (1-9)
2. **Turns**: Players alternate placing X or O in empty cells
3. **Scoring**: Points are calculated after each move
4. **Game End**: When all cells are filled (9 moves total)
5. **Winner**: Player with the highest score wins

## Winning Conditions

- **Win**: Player with the highest score when board is full
- **Tie**: Both players have equal scores when board is full
- **No Draw**: Unlike traditional Tic-Tac-Toe, there's always a winner due to scoring

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Dimensional Support
- Game supports larger board dimensions (3x3 and up)
- Scoring adapts to board size
- More complex patterns possible on larger boards

### Game History
- All moves are tracked and displayed
- Shows the sequence: X1→O2→X3→O4...
- Final move is highlighted when game ends

### Responsive Design
- Works on desktop and mobile devices
- Board size adjusts to screen dimensions
- Touch-friendly interface

## Strategy Tips

1. **Block Opponent**: Prevent opponent from creating three-in-a-row patterns
2. **Create Multiple Patterns**: Try to set up moves that create multiple scoring opportunities
3. **Center Control**: The center cell (5) is often valuable for creating diagonal patterns
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Look for opportunities to complete existing two-in-a-row patterns

## Multiplayer Mode

- **Local**: Two players on the same device
- **Online**: Play with friends over the internet (Beta feature)
- **Real-time**: Synchronized gameplay with live updates

## Game Controls
